# Bluetooth_Matlab

## The Bluetooth system under the 3 modes:

*uncoded(1Mbps) Mode :1

*coded with rate ½, (500Kbps) Mode :2

*coded with rate½ and pattern mapping (125Kbps) Mode :8


## program
i. ble_digital_comm_course.m is the main program

ii. demapping.m is the demapping function

iii. detector_synch.m is the detector function

iv. fec_enc.m is the encoding function. Coding using 1/2 convolutional code.

v. fec_decode.m is the decoding function.

vi. gfsk_modulation.m is the modulation function and we use gfsk modulate

vii. gfsk.demode.m is the demode function.

viii. pattern_mapping.m is the pattern mapping function.

ix. pulse_shape.m is the pulse shape function.
